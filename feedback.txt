Do you feel this project helped you to understand the following ideas:
(please answer yes, no, somewhat, and comment on what if anything could
have improved your learning experience).

1) The main steps of a robot localization algorithm
Yes. You provide us with a great map (which is very suitable for implementing
histogram-based localization) and a great robotics kit to work with. The
project goal is also perfectly tailored for localization.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) Dealing with real-world sensors
Yes. The sensors are very useful and common in real-world robotics, and they
have the noisy characteristics that we need to deal with :(, which is also 
similar to the situation we might encounter in practice. However, it may be
a bit difference, since in real-world situation we might have more choices
and/or methods to work with various sensors and tackle the noise problem, 
while in our project the number and type of sensors are limited. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) Dealing with real-world motors and robot motions
Yes. We have been learning the different usage of motor and trying to solve 
the motor noise during the project. The experience with motors and robot 
motions also makes us understand PID controllers better.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
4) Using probabilities to keep track of belief about a robot's position

Yes. Working on the localization algorithm helped re-enforce the 
lessons in the notes and lecture, and showed why each step is 
important.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
5) Managing uncertainty (e.g. in the quality of sensor readings, or accuracy of
robot motions)
Somehow yes. This project covered most of the uncertainty we have learnt
during the lectures, and we got changes to apply the methods in it. However,
due to the time limit, the unmaintained robotics and our limited skills,
we sometimes only feel frustrated and feel like we are not able to completely 
solve the problems.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
6) Do you feel confident you could implement a probabilistic localization algorithm
for a more complex robot, working in a real world environment?
(please explain your answer)

Somewhat. Histgram localization is something that we've grasped through the project
but with real world environments, there's much more noise and uncertainty that it 
may be too much. Also because it's the real world, I'm assuming things can't perfectly
be separated into boxes and we would need particle filter localization, which we hadn't
touched in the project.

7) Any other comments regarding your experience with this project?

The mere thought of carrying lego parts that are incredibly expensive has made
me very afraid of walking across the street with it. ~ Vivian.
